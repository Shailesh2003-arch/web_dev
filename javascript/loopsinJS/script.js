// will be discussing about loops in this lecture...
// loop is a block of code that executes required number of times specified by the user....
// In javascript, there are 6 types of loops...

// 1) for loop (general/regular for loop that runs for a specified number of times...)
//    for loop is preferred when you know exactly how many iterations to be performed beforehand...


    // Syntax of for loop...

    // for(initialization;condition;increment/decrement)
    
/*      {
            // lines of code...
        }

*/

// A simple for loop printing from 1 to 10...

for(i=1;i<=10;i++){
    console.log(i);
}
